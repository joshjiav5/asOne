### Features
   - Periodic update of geolocation and battery
   - Status sharing
   - Battery life level notifications: when battery is at 5% send location and push notification (in progress)
   - Audio recording triggering by friend in group in case of emergency (status not updated in a while, location elsewhere, phone about to die and not responding), but this audio will not be streamed or leave the user’s device. Can only be shared/released by the owner of the device, to combat he said / she said (in progress)
   - Ping (Soft push or loud sound played) (in progress)

## TODO
   - Group creation flow
   - I’m home automatic ping 
   - Uber integration: if phone dies while driving, we can use the Uber API to let the group know their friend has gotten home safe
